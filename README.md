# artificial-neural-variability-for-deep-learning

The Pytorch Implementation of Variable Optimizers/ Neural Variable Risk Minimization. 

The algortihms are proposed in our paper: 
[Artificial Neural Variability for Deep Learning: On Overfitting, Noise Memorization, and Catastrophic Forgetting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.06220), which will appear in Neural Computation.


# Why Artificial Neural Variability?

We introduce a neuroscience concept, called neural variability, into deep learning. 

It helps DNNs learn from neuroscience.

At negligible computational and coding costs, our neuroscience-inspired optimization method can 

(1) enhance the robustness to weight perturbation;

(2) improve generalizability;

(3) relieve the memorization of noisy labels;

(4) mitigate catastrophic forgetting.

# The environment is as bellow:

Ubuntu 18.04.4 LTS

Python >= 3.7.3 

PyTorch >= 1.4.0



# Code Example: 

You may use it as a standard Pytorch optimizer.

```python
from variable_optim import VSGD

optimizer = VSGD(net.parameters(), lr=lr, variability=variability, num_iters=num_iters, weight_decay=weight_decay)
```
